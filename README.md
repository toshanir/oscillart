Description
A unique art and music jam all in one code? This project was really fun as I got to explore the math and art beheind the wonderful
sin waves that are really intresting as I researched a bit on them. Fun Fact: Every sound you make is a sin wave which is really cool

--------------------
**Features**
-> Cute asthetic backround 
-> Cute button 
-> Cool waves (math isn't my strongest area when it comes to sin waves but I tried D:)

---------------------------------------------
**Motivation** 
-> I really loved this project and what really motivated me is to put effort into coding this whole entrie project which was really cool 

----------------------------------------------
Challeges 
-> One challege I faced is to figure out the background and how to set it up and to make the cute stuff which I needed to research so I use like W3Schools
